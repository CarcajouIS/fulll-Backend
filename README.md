# Step 3: Enhancing Code Quality and Setting Up CI/CD

## Code Quality Tools

- Use a linter (eg. Eslint, Prettier) to fix code issues/code smells, ensure consistent formatting
- Use Unit test framework (Jest) to write and run unit tests
- Use Git Hooks to ensure that code is linted and tested before commit/push

## CI/CD Setup

1. **Create Workflow File**
2. **Define Jobs**
    - Lint
    - Unit Tests
3. **Configure Deployment**
    - Build
    - Integration Test
    - Deploy
